# Election Analysis Project

This R project is designed to analyze election data. It provides insights into voting patterns, voter demographics, and election outcomes. The main script, `election.R`, contains the code necessary for conducting the analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need R installed on your machine. You can download R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Prerequisites

Before running the `election.R` script, ensure you have the following R packages installed:

- ggplot2
- dplyr
- readr

You can install these packages using the following commands in R console:

on MacOS just type R in terminal
```
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("readr")
```
